    Elements is an open source, sidechain-capable blockchain platform, providing access to powerful features developed by members of the community, such as Confidential Transactions and Issued Assets.
# These assets are static files necessary for packaging the service for Start9 (into an s9pk). Each value is a path to the specified asset. If an asset is missing from this list, or otherwise denoted, it will be defaulted to the values denoted below. 
assets:
  # Default = LICENSE.md
  license: LICENSE
  # Default = icon.png (.svg allowed)
  icon: icon.png
  # Default = INSTRUCTIONS.md
  instructions: instructions.md
  # Default = image.tar
